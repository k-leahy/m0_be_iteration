# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
# I don't feel comfortable at all with this, it was extremely hard for me.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
# Today has been a tough day, it made me extremely uncomfortable. I am feeling like this is definitely not my learning style.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
# I feel like it is snowballing right now and not sure what to do.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
